Photos-Video-Archive
=========
Export, compress and archive your videos from theOS X Photos app to save on space.

We're still working on how to tie this all together, but the goal is to export your videos from Photos, compressing them with Handbrake, and preserving the file creation date througout the entire process.  

iPhones shoot high-quality movies.  Those videos eat up tons of space.  After accumulating hundreds of videos (mostly of my kids) I needed a way to compress those videos.  Also, and perhaps this is just me, but I prefer organizing videos on the filesystem and let the "Photos" app handle photos.  I need an approach that 

* exports videos from Photos
* corrects video rotation
* preserves slomo edits
* compresses down to 720p
* sets the original video creation time on the compressed video
